## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Rackarr, please report it by:

1. **Email**: Create an issue at https://github.com/ggfevans/rackarr/issues (or the primary repository)
2. **Response Time**: We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours
3. **Disclosure**: Please allow us time to address the issue before public disclosure

## AI-Generated Code

Code generated with AI assistance undergoes the same security review process as human-written code.

### Our Approach

- All contributions (AI-assisted or traditional) are tested against our comprehensive test suite (791 tests as of v0.1)
- AI-generated code receives human review before merging
- Security-sensitive code receives additional scrutiny regardless of authorship
- Dependencies are regularly audited using `npm audit`

### Security Considerations

- **Client-Side Only**: Rackarr runs entirely in the browser with no backend server, reducing attack surface
- **No External Data**: No user data is transmitted to external servers
- **Local Storage**: Session data is stored in browser localStorage (user-controlled)
- **No Authentication**: No user accounts or authentication system to compromise

## Best Practices for Users

When using Rackarr:

- Review exported files before sharing, as they may contain infrastructure details
- Be cautious about loading `.rackarr.json` files from untrusted sources
- Keep your browser updated to ensure latest security patches

## Dependency Security

We maintain security through:

- Regular dependency updates
- Automated security scanning via `npm audit`
- Minimal dependency footprint
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality and linting
